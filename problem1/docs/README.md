# Problem Statement
Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

# Interface Exposed

- is_overlap(x1 int/float, x2 int/float, x3 int/float, x4 int/float) : returns Boolean,
